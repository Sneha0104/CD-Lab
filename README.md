S7 Compiler Design Lab Programs

Cycle 1:
  - [ ] Write program to find ε – closure of all states of any given NFA with ε transition.Virtual programming lab
  - [ ] Write program to convert NFA with ε transition to NFA without εtransition.Virtual programming lab
  - [ ] Write program to convert NFA toDFAVirtual programming lab
  - [ ] Write program to minimize any given DFA.Virtual programming lab

Cycle 2:
  - [ ] Design and implement a lexical analyzer for given language using C and the lexical analyzer should ignore redundant spaces, tabs and newlines.
